# Spring Petclinic Project - Upgrade with AI Instructions

This repository demonstrates how to use an AI coding assistant to upgrade a popular Java project from Java 17 to Java 21.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a test bed for validating the AI-assisted Java upgrade instructions described in the accompanying article. The source code is a snapshot taken from the [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) project, which currently uses Java 17. The primary objective is to leverage an AI coding assistant to upgrade the codebase to newer Java versions.
