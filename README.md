## Purpose

This repository is a **work in progress** focused on exploring the use of AI coding agents for Java version upgrades.

The source code in this repository is a snapshot taken from the [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) project, which currently uses Java 17. The primary objective of this exploration is to leverage AI coding agents to upgrade the codebase to Java 21 and Java 25.

The outcome of this exploration will be a set of AI-generated instructions and best practices for automated Java version upgrades.
